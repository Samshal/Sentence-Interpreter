/*-----------------------------------------
*1.Add a method that checks
*  for synonyms to words. This
   class should be able to isolate
   the best/closest synonym to such
   words depending on the context in
   which it is used
2. Using this synonyms from the method
   above, another class will be created
   for generating sentences similar/connotes
   almost the same meaning as the one used for
   instantiating the class but using different words
3. Another method for generating completely opposite
   meaning to a sentence will be provided using a method
   that gets the opposite (Antonyms) to a word
#####-------SUMMARY OF THIS TODO LIST-------#####
	Four more methods shall be added.
    Possible names include
    	1. check_syn(<parameters not yet none>)
    		checks for the synonyms to words
    	2. check_ant(<parameters not yet none>)
    		checks for the antonyms to words
    	3. generate_same(<parameters not yet none>)
    		generates sentences with the same semantical
    		meaning but different syntactical connotation
    	4. generate_opposite(<parameters not yet none>)
    		generates the exact opposite meaning to a sentence
